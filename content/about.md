I am a platform engineer at Anynines, where I work on building and designing 
Kubernetes control plane components for managing data services at scale. I am
interested in thinking about distributed systems, Linux and security. My drive
is in conceiving, designing, and improving systems that can make computers and
organisations work better.

Outside of that, I like mountain biking and high quality audio.
